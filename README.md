# Quantifing methylation data from ONT Long Reads
This repository includes a collection of scripts that are being developed into a pipeline for processing methylation data from aligned ONT long reads. The current output is used for visualzing methylation data for the ONT Data Explorer R shiny app: https://millerlaboratory.shinyapps.io/Data_Explorer_V1/. The goal is to use the eventual pipeline for determining X-inactivation status on whole genomes sequenced with ONT. These scripts are written and maintianed by Sophia Gibson in the Miller Laboratory at The University of Washington.
